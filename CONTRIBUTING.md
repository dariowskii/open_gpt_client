# CONTRIBUTING

## Get Started

To run the project locally you need to have the `Flutter SDK` installed on your machine.

If you haven't downloaded it yet, you can consult the official guide [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

### After installing Flutter

After successfully installing the `Flutter SDK`, to start the project locally you need to create a file called `".env"` (unnamed) in the root of the project - at the same level as the `pubspec.yaml` file.

In this way the file is recognized within the assets and the project is compiled correctly.

**It is not necessary to insert any content inside the `.env` file** to make the project work, as in the original file there is only the GitHub API key to check for new releases.

## Issues

If working on the project you find bugs or crashes, **open an issue** by selecting the appropriate template and setting the labels that seem more consistent to you.

## Features

To submit a new feature, open an issue by selecting the **`enhancement`** tag and filling out the new feature template.

## Pull requests

**IMPORTANT: Contributions should refer to the open issues or development roadmap.**

To contribute you need to follow these steps:

1. Fork the repo: Click the `"Fork"` button on the main repository page to create a copy of the repo on your personal GitHub page.

2. Clone the repo fork: Open your Terminal or Command Prompt and type the command `git clone url-of-your-repo-fork` followed by the name of the local directory where you want to clone the repo.

3. Create a new branch: Type `git checkout -b name-of-your-branch` to create a new separate working branch. The branch name must be descriptive of your contribution.

4. Make Changes: Use your favorite text editor to make the necessary changes to the repo. Make sure you follow the project guidelines and maintain a consistent style with the rest of the documentation.

5. Add modified files: type `git add name-of-modified-file` to add the modified files to the staging area.

6. Commit the changes: Type `git commit -m 'Description of the changes made'` to commit the changes to your branch. If you have resolved an open issue enter the issue reference in the commit message.

7. Push branch fork: Type `git push origin name-of-your-branch` to push your branch to your fork repo on GitHub.

8. Create a pull request: Go to the original repo's main page and click the `"Create pull request"` button. Select your branch and enter a detailed description of the changes made.
